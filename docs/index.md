# Hello & Welcome

This is the portfolio of Gao Su.

How the time damm flies! I have passed my bachelor studium as a Indutrial Design student, my master studium as a Multimedia Design student. And now I'm a husband, the papa of _Dian_ and a **junior full-time Software Developer.** 

I'm interested in many things: swimming, skating, outdoor, design, electronic. I've tried several different industries branches. I always make sure what I'm doing is what I'm interested in and no harm for the world. I'm a big lover for Steve Job's philosophy: [**"Think Different"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEPhLqwKo6g&ab_channel=jeremytai). I will try my best to _connectiong the dots_ and _follow my hear_. I believe this is the single way to be I'd wanna to be.

Besides thousand of Job's sayings. These are also my favorite Mottos.


_Being always interested in continiously learning new things.</br>
Enjoy every moments with coding, soldering and making._
